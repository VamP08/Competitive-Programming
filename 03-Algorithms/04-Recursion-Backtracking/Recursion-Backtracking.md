## **Algorithms: Recursion & Backtracking**

### **Conceptual Overview**

**Recursion** and **Backtracking** are closely related techniques that are essential for exploring all possible solutions to a problem in a systematic way.

* **Recursion:** A technique where a function solves a problem by calling itself with a smaller or simpler version of the same problem. Every recursive function must have:  
  1. **Base Case:** A condition that stops the recursion.  
  2. Recursive Step: The part of the function that calls itself.  
     Recursion is a natural fit for problems with a hierarchical or self-similar structure, like tree traversals or divide-and-conquer algorithms.  
* **Backtracking:** A refined brute-force approach that builds a solution incrementally. It explores a path, and if the path leads to a dead end or violates a constraint, it "backtracks" (reverts the last choice) and tries a different path. Backtracking is essentially a form of recursion that is used to explore a state-space tree of all possible solutions.

### **The Backtracking Template**

A general template for backtracking problems that generate all valid solutions:

C++

\#**include** \<iostream\>  
\#**include** \<vector\>

bool is\_valid(const std::vector\<int\>& current\_solution) {  
    // Logic to check if the current partial solution is valid  
    return true;  
}

void solve(std::vector\<std::vector\<int\>\>& all\_solutions, std::vector\<int\>& current\_solution, int n) {  
    // Base Case: if a complete solution is found  
    if (current\_solution.size() \== n) {  
        all\_solutions.push\_back(current\_solution);  
        return;  
    }

    // Explore choices  
    for (int choice \= 1; choice \<= n; \++choice) {  
        // Make a choice  
        current\_solution.push\_back(choice);

        // Check if the choice is valid before recursing  
        if (is\_valid(current\_solution)) {  
            // Recurse  
            solve(all\_solutions, current\_solution, n);  
        }

        // Backtrack: undo the choice  
        current\_solution.pop\_back();  
    }  
}

### **Real-World Applications**

* **Solving Puzzles:** Finding solutions to mazes, Sudoku puzzles, and the N-Queens problem.  
* **Generating Combinations/Permutations:** Finding all possible subsets or arrangements of a set of items.  
* **Parsing:** Compilers use recursion (in the form of recursive descent parsers) to analyze the structure of code.  
* **Artificial Intelligence:** Game-playing AI (like in chess) uses backtracking with optimizations (like alpha-beta pruning) to explore possible moves.
