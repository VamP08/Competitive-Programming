## **Graph Theory: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**

### **Conceptual Overview**

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a connected, undirected, and weighted graph is a subgraph that connects all the vertices together with the minimum possible total edge weight, without forming any cycles. An MST will always have exactly Vâˆ’1 edges, where V is the number of vertices.

### **Key Algorithms**

Both main algorithms for finding an MST are greedy algorithms.

* **Kruskal's Algorithm:**  
  * **Approach:** Sorts all edges by weight. It then iterates through the sorted edges, adding an edge to the MST if it does not form a cycle.  
  * **Data Structure:** Uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to efficiently detect cycles.  
  * **Complexity:** O(ElogE) or O(ElogV), dominated by edge sorting.  
  * **Best For:** Sparse graphs (where E is close to V).  
* **Prim's Algorithm:**  
  * **Approach:** Grows the MST from an arbitrary start vertex. At each step, it adds the cheapest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to one outside it.  
  * **Data Structure:** Uses a priority queue to efficiently find the minimum weight edge.  
  * **Complexity:** O(ElogV) with a binary heap.  
  * **Best For:** Dense graphs (where E is close to V2).

### **Real-World Applications**

* **Network Design:** Designing least-cost networks for telecommunications, water supply, or electrical grids.  
* **Circuit Design:** Minimizing the wire length needed to connect components.  
* **Cluster Analysis:** Finding clusters of points in a dataset.
