## **Fast Input/Output (I/O)**

### **Conceptual Overview**

In competitive programming, problems often involve large amounts of input and output. Standard I/O operations in languages like C++ (cin/cout) and Java (Scanner) can be surprisingly slow and may lead to a "Time Limit Exceeded" (TLE) verdict, even if your algorithm is efficient. Fast I/O techniques are simple code additions that significantly speed up these operations. \[3\]

### **Fast I/O in C++**

The standard cin and cout streams in C++ are synchronized with C's stdio streams (scanf, printf) by default, which causes a major slowdown. \[3\]

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Disable Synchronization:** Add std::ios\_base::sync\_with\_stdio(false); at the beginning of your main function. \[3\]  
2. **Untie cin from cout:** Add std::cin.tie(NULL); right after. This prevents cout from being flushed before every cin operation. \[3\]  
3. **Use \\n instead of endl:** endl forces a flush of the output buffer. Using '\\n' is much faster for large outputs. \[3\]

A standard C++ template should always start with these lines:

```
#include <iostream>

// Other necessary headers or <bits/stdc++.h> if allowed

int main() {
    // Fast I/O: Speeds up input and output operations.
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    // Your main solution code goes here
    
    return 0;
}
```
### **Practice Platforms**

To test the effectiveness of your fast I/O implementation, solve problems specifically designed with large datasets.
