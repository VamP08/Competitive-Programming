# Competitive Programming & DSA Journey

A comprehensive repository containing structured guides, implementation templates, and curated practice problems for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms. This project is my personal knowledge base for mastering DSA for competitive programming and technical interviews.

## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is more than just a collection of solutions; it's a structured learning environment. Each topic is organized into its own directory containing a detailed `README.md` file that acts as a revision guide. These guides include:

* **Conceptual Overviews:** Brief but thorough explanations of core concepts.
* **Implementation Templates:** Clean, well-commented C++ code for key algorithms.
* **Complexity Analysis:** Time and space complexity for major operations.
* **Curated Practice Problems:** A handpicked list of problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CSES to solidify understanding.
