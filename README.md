# Competitive Programming & DSA Journey

A comprehensive repository containing structured guides, implementation templates, and curated practice problems for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms. This project is my personal knowledge base for learning DSA for competitive programming and technical interviews. I have implemented the solution for the problem publicly in this repository so that everyone can use this as a template for leaning DSA implementing their own solution and organize their learning.

## About This Repository

This repository is a structured learning environment. Each topic is organized into its own directory containing a detailed `README.md` file that acts as a revision guide. These guides include:

* **Conceptual Overviews:** Brief but thorough explanations of core concepts.
* **Implementation Templates:** Clean, well-commented C++ code for key algorithms.(Add as per learning)
* **Complexity Analysis:** Time and space complexity for major operations.
* **Curated Practice Problems:** A handpicked list of problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, and CSES to solidify understanding.
